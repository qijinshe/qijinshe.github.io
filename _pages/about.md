My name is Qijin She (佘奇晋). I'm the last-year postgraduate student at National University of Defense Technology (NUDT), under the supervison of Prof. [Kai Xu](https://kevinkaixu.net/).
Before that, I obtained my B.Eng. degree in software engineering from Shandong University in 2015, advised by Prof. [Weiguo Liu](https://faculty.sdu.edu.cn/liuweiguo1/en/lwcg/608651/list/4.htm).

I interned at Visual Computing Research Center (VCC), Shenzhen University, mentored by Prof. [Ruizhen Hu](https://csse.szu.edu.cn/staff/ruizhenhu/) and Prof. [Hui Huang](https://vcc.tech/~huihuang) from Mar. 2021 to Mar. 2022. 

My research interest lies in learning methods (especially, reinforcement learning) for robotic manipulation and interaction animation generataion.
