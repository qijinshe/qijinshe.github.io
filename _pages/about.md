Before that, I obtained my B.Eng. degree in software engineering from Shandong University in 2015, advised by Prof. Weiguo Liu.

I interned at Visual Computing Research Center (VCC), Shenzhen University, mentored by Prof. [Ruizhen Hu](https://csse.szu.edu.cn/staff/ruizhenhu/) and Prof. [Hui Huang](https://vcc.tech/~huihuang) from Mar. 2021 to Mar. 2022.
