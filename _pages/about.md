My name is Qijin She (佘奇晋). I'm a master student at National University of Defense Technology, under the supervison of Prof. [Kai Xu](https://kevinkaixu.net/).
I also work closely with Prof. [Chenyang Zhu](http://www.zhuchenyang.net/), Prof. [Ruizhen Hu](https://csse.szu.edu.cn/staff/ruizhenhu/) and Prof. [Hui Huang](https://vcc.tech/~huihuang).
I obtained my B.Eng. degree in Software Engineering from Shandong University, advised by Prof. [Weiguo Liu](https://faculty.sdu.edu.cn/liuweiguo1/en/lwcg/608651/list/4.htm). 


My research interests are in reinforcement learning, computer graphics and robotics, focusing on applying learning methods to robotic manipulation problems as well as animation generation.
